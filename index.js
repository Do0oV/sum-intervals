// TEST: Sum of Intervals

// Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test.

// CHALLENGE

// Write a function called sumIntervals that accepts an array of intervals and
// returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals
// should only be counted once.
// EXAMPLE: sumIntervals([[1,4], [3,5]]) ==> 4

// INTERVALLS

// Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form
// of an array. The first value of the interval will less than the 
// second one

// TESTING YOUR SOLUTION

// To test your solution, run 'npm install' in the root directory
// and then run 'npm test' to run the automated tests.

// SUBMITTING YOUR SOLUTION

// When done, make sure you're working on a forked repo, push your
// changes to your forked repo and submit a pull request.

function sumIntervals(intervals) {

}

// the cake is a lie
// the cake is a lie
// the cake is a lie
